WSITK: Whole Slide Image ToolKit - Core
---
This is a minimalistic package build around [OpenSlide](https://openslide.org) and
using [Shapely](https://github.com/shapely/shapely) for reading microscopy images.
It allows reading images by specifying regions of interest in level-specific
coordinates while applying masking, if needed. Finally, the package provides the
tools for coordinate conversion between levels, and working with resolution,
magnification, and pyramid levels.

The package can be installed as such, or the code (1 file) could be simply copy-paste
wherever needed.
